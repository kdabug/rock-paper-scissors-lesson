# ROCK - PAPER - SCISSORS
### Loops and Conditionals in Computer Programming

## Intro

Computers are obedient. Computers are also dumb. They don't "think for themselves". They do exactly what you tell them - and only what you tell them. Let's take a moment and imagine you are a computer for the day. I tell you to wake up and make cereal for breakfast. I give you a specific set of instructions. 

1) Go to the kitchen
2) Open the cupboard
3) Grab a box of cereal
4) Get a bowl and milk
5) Pour the cereal into a bowl
6) Take a bite of cereal
7) Finish eating your cereal
8) Wash dishes off in the sink
9) Put dishes away

Did you notice that you did not pour milk in the bowl? Or that you could have been eating standing, with a fork. Most importantly, did you catch that you only actually ate one bite of cereal?!

As computer scientists and programmers, we get to focus on solving problems using the least energy possible. Let's face it - you only getting one bite of cereal is a problem! - and we can FIX IT! But how do we program "computer you" so that you can eat every bite of cereal? We don't want to add 100 "Take a bite of cereal" steps to our morning breakfast program! And what if you pour a different amount of cereal every day - one day you eat your cereal in 20 bites, another you eat it in 120 bites. 

Let's put this problem (and our spoons) aside for a second and look at how we would use two critical computer science concepts to tackle a similar problem.

##  Loops


## Conditionals


## Wrap - Up

Loops and conditionals are critical when it comes to saving energy and space. We don't know how many bites of cereal are in your bowl each morning, just like we don't know how many rounds of rock, paper, scissors you will need to play in order to determine who will wash all of the dishes. Loops tell the program to repeat a step (or multiple steps) an unspecified number of times. Likewise, Conditionals will tell the program to act differently when faced with different scenarios. What happens when you play 'rock' and your friend throws down 'scissors'? Or determining the step that will follow your first bite versus the step that will follow your last.
